One solution I found for the September 2020 IBM Ponder This challenge is...

0 -> 1, 3, 4, 5
1 -> 2, 3, 4, 5
2 -> 0, 3, 4, 5
3 -> 4, 6, 7, 8
4 -> 5, 6, 7, 8
5 -> 3, 6, 7, 8
6 -> 7, 0, 1, 2
7 -> 8, 0, 1, 2
8 -> 6, 0, 1, 2

That should lead to 81 automorphisms of the graph. My approach was as follows. Divide the 9 weapons into three 3-cycles (like three original rock-paper-scissors games): 012, 345 and 678. Then have outgoing edges from each of the vertices 0,1,2 to each of the vertices 3,4,5. Similarly, have outgoing edges from each of the vertices 3,4,5 to each of the vertices 6,7,8. Similarly, have outgoing edges from each of the vertices 6,7,8 to each of the vertices 0,1,2. Like a meta rock-paper-scissors between the three 3-cycle groups! Due to the symmetries involved, we can rotate within any of the 3-cycle groups 012, 345 and 678. We can also rotate the three groups. Thus there should be 3^4 = 81 automorphisms for the graph.
