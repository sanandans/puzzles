One solution I found for the July 2020 IBM Ponder This challenge is...
 {"A": "AB", "B": "AAAC", "C": "AAC"}

The desired lengths of the sequence (i.e. F(n)*F(n+1) from n=1) are 1,2,6,15,40,104,273,714,1870... 
With {"A": "AB", "B": "AAAC", "C": "AAC"}, the first few strings would be: A -> AB -> ABAAAC -> ABAAACABABABAAC -> ABAAACABABABAACABAAACABAAACABAAACABABAAC, and the sequence of strings will continue to have the desired lengths.

My approach was mainly trial and error along with trying to incorporate the fact that the sequence of lengths can be obtained by adding 
the squares of corresponding Fibonacci numbers to the terms. One observation that I wanted to share: The A's form a sequence 
1,1,4,9,25,64... which are the squares of the Fibonacci numbers (starting from n=1). The B's form a similar sequence 0,1,1,4,9,25,64... 
(but starting from n=0). The C's form a sequence 0,0,1,2,6,15,40,104,273... which is F(n)*F(n+1) if we ignore the first 0.
