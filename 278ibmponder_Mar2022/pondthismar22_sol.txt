For n = 5, one solution is p = 17923, E[p] = 1016452 / 8363 = 121.541552

This is assuming I interpreted your "yellow" rule correctly since the yellow rule varies in different Wordle versions. Please let me know 
if I misinterpreted your yellow rule, and I'll tweak my program. From your f(3637, 4733) = 11 example, it looks like you treat yellow as 
purely an indicator that there is at least one occurrence of that digit (in some other place). In some Wordle version rules, I think 
2731, 7039, 8731, and 9739 would not be allowed in the remaining list after a first guess of 3637 (for target 4733) because there's a 
green 3 and a yellow 3. Since 4733 also has two 3's, the yellow 3 in 3637 would indicate that there is a second yellow 3 in the solution 
number. Anyway, I have interpreted your yellow rule based on your  f(3637, 4733) = 11 example. This also means that, if the solution 
number has only one 3, but the first guess has two 3's in different places, then both 3's would be marked yellow even though there is 
only one 3 in the solution number.

I wrote a C program. It first stores all the 5-digit primes (split by digits). It also pre stores a lookup for all these primes to map 
which digits exist or not in them. It loops through the different (p,q) pairs and computes the sum of f(p,q). Among the 8363 5-digit 
primes, the lowest sum it found was 1016452, and the earliest this sum was achieved was with p = 17923. 
Expected value =  1016452 / 8363 = 121.541552
