It was immediately clear that the question is asking about Leyland primes. Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares says that the given property #3 can be satisfied only if the prime is 1 mod 4. Fermat's related results state that the given property #4 can be satisfied only if the prime is 1 or 3 mod 8. There's an additional result I read that the given property #5 can be satisfied only if the prime is 1, 9, 11, 15, 23 or 25 mod 28. The list of Leyland primes is available in OEIS  A094133, and includes the (a,b) pairs. I looped through the Leyland primes to determine the ones that satisfy the above conditions of remainders. Apart from the two examples given in the problem, the first one I found satisfying the conditions was 523347633027360537213687137. Then I used Wolfram Alpha to compute the (x,y) pairs for properties 3-5. For the bonus "*" question, the first Leyland prime greater than googol is 7259701736680389461922586102342375953169154793471358981661239413987142371528493467259545421437269088935158394128249.
This Leyland prime satisfied the conditions to get integer solutions for the given properties 3-5. Again I used Wolfram Alpha to compute the (x,y) pairs.
