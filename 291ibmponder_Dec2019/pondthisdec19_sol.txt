An expression I determined that uses no more than 15 +,-,*,/ operations and approximates abs(x) in the interval [-1,1] with MSE less 
than 0.0001 is...

(x*x*(2.1975*x*x + 0.4903)) / (x*x*(x*x + 1.6381) + 0.0498)

This has MSE of about 0.000075 with respect to abs(x) in the [-1,1] interval.

Due to the precision needed, polynomial approximation would need a large-degree polynomial which would not be possible to express within 
15 basic operations. I used the Newton approximation theorem for abs(x) in the [-1,1] interval. For the rational function, my thought was 
to keep the degree of the polynomials in numerator and denominator down to 4 to be able to write the full expression within 15 basic 
operations. Once I had worked out the above Newton rational function on paper, I used the online Desmos integral calculator to estimate 
the MSE with respect to abs(x) in the [-1,1] interval, 
i.e. mean value of (abs(x) - ((x*x*(2.1975*x*x + 0.4903))/(x*x*(x*x + 1.6381) + 0.0498)))^2 in [-1,1]. The MSE came to about 0.000075.

By the way, for the example given in the challenge, I get an MSE of 1/6 (not 1/8 as given). This might be a typographical error or I'm 
misunderstanding something. The square error function is ((3x+1)/2)^2 with respect to abs(x) in [-1,0], and the MSE in [-1,0] is 1/4. The 
square error function is ((1-x)/2)^2 with respect to abs(x) in [0,1], and the MSE in [0,1] is 1/12. So, in [-1,1], I get MSE as 1/6.
