My IBM Ponder This December '23 challenge main and bonus * solutions

Main puzzle (find one value of m for which f(m) is exactly 1000000):
m = 4313134 is a palindrome where f(4313134) = 1000000

Bonus * (list of all values of m where f(m) is exactly 1000000):
4310930, 4311298, 4312919, 4313134, 4313718

This short program counts the desired circles within the washer ring
region in the first quadrant, where the region is bounded by the concentric
circles of radii m and m+1. The program completed in 7 seconds for the main puzzle;
I constrained the search to palindromes in the range 4.31 million to 4.315 million
(based on results I saw with sporadic runs for some m values).
To avoid floats, I use a scaled grid where side length of equilateral triangle is 2
units, and I use radius squared rather than radius. Only the first quadrant of the
grid is used. The program looks to count the desired circles by traversing the grid
ines in a particular order. Consider the grid line through (m+1, 0), i.e. (2m+2,0) in
this setup with triangle side lengths of 2 units. This line makes an angle of 120 degrees
with the positive direction of the X-axis. First, the program traverses the triangular lattice
points on this grid line to find circles in the washer ring region. Then it moves to the parallel
grid line on the left which passes through (m, 0), i.e. (2m, 0) in this setup of side lengths 2.
It traverses this grid line starting from beyond the circle of radius
m. It repeats this process for every parallel grid line, right to left, to count
circles in the washer ring region, always trying to stay in the washer ring region.
Distinct circles are ensured by using a set to store the squared radii found.
I first tested the program for the given examples (m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 11, 42), and then
ran it for a few sporadic m values to narrow the range that I would need to search.
Thanks to the palindrome hint, the program took only 7 seconds to find a palindromic
answer.

I ran the same program for a range for the bonus * question. The function f(m) doesnâ€™t
exhibit a smoothly non-decreasing behavior, sometimes fluctuating to materially smaller
function values for larger m. So I took an educated a guess at what range might cover
all m values that give f(m) = 1000000. The program ran for a couple of hours to find
the five m values for the bonus * search. If multiple cores can be spared for this search,
we can use multi threading and split the range. Mutex/semaphore/thread barriers not needed
as f(m) is independent for each m.
