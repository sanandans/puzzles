Any of the following four-experiment sequences would work:
(1,2,4), then (1,3,5), then (1,2,6), then (1,3,4).
(1,2,5), then (1,3,4), then (1,2,6), then (1,3,5).
(1,3,4), then (1,2,6), then (1,3,5), then (1,2,4).
(1,3,5), then (1,2,6), then (1,3,4), then (1,2,5).
If Alice uses any one of the four four-experiment sequences listed above, Bob's observations will be:
(a) Exactly one balloon was common across all four experiments. Let's call it balloon X.
(b) Between any two consecutive experiments, Alice changed both the other balloons (apart from balloon X) involved in the previous 
experiment.
(c) No two experiments had an identical three-balloon set.

Based on the above observations, Bob knows that Alice has used one of the four four-experiment sequences mentioned above (with three 
balloons used in each experiment). No other four-experiment sequence (with three balloons used in each experiment) exists that is in line 
with the observations. In any of these four four-experiment sequences, the balloon X that is common across all four experiments is the 
balloon with 1-gram lifting power. Thus, by doing four experiments using one of the above sequences, Alice has proved to Bob which 
balloon has the 1-gram lifting power, so which color it is.
