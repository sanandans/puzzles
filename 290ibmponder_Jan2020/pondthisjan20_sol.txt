One solution I found for the January 2020 IBM Ponder This challenge is "L.JK.HI; G.FI.EK; D.H.CJ; B.E.CF".

I wrote a small C program. It ran for 38 seconds to find the above solution. Firstly, we can note that it's redundant to use a barrel on 
the same orchid on two separate days. A barrel can be used on a given orchid on day 1 or day 2 or day 3 or it might not be used on that 
orchid at all. Thus, each barrel is equivalent to a 4-digit number, with the leftmost digit representing when the barrel is used on 
orchid1, the next digit representing when it's used on orchid2, the next digit representing when it's used on orchid3, and the rightmost 
digit representing when it's used on orchid4. The possible values for each digit are 1, 2, 3 or 4 where a digit's value represents which 
day the barrel is used on the orchid corresponding to that digit (4 means the barrel is not used on that orchid on any of the three 
days). For example, a barrel with the number 4342 would not be tested on orchid1 and orchid3, and would be used on orchid2 on day 3, and 
on orchid4 on day 2. If barrels 4342 and 4414 were poisonous (as an example), then the outcome would be 4312, i.e. orchid1 would be alive 
after 3 days, orchid2 would die at the end of day 3, orchid3 would die at the end of day 1, and orchid4 would die at the end of day 2. 
The recursive program looks for 12 numbers such that every pairwise outcome is distinct (for 12 barrels, there would be 66 such pairwise 
outcomes). The distinct outcome of which orchid dies on which day (or stays alive after 3 days) determines the exact poisonous pair of 
barrels. The list of 256 potential 4-digit numbers can be pruned since several numbers are not possible. For example, 2122 or 1131 
cannot lead to eleven distinct outcomes when combined with other barrels.

The program loops through the pruned list of potential barrel numbers in descending order, and looks for the next barrel (from the 
subsequent number onwards). It determines the outcomes of combining a barrel with previously identified barrels (taking the digit-wise 
minimum of the two numbers in each pair). If a conflicting outcome is found, it moves on to the next barrel at that level. It recursively 
searches for barrels at subsequent levels until it has found one at the 12th level, which means 12 numbers with 66 distinct pairwise 
outcomes have been found. The 12 barrel numbers the program first found were 4444, 4441, 4433, 4414, 4342, 4243, 4144, 3424, 3244, 2434, 
2344 and 1444. Labeling these as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L respectively gives us the solution 
"L.JK.HI; G.FI.EK; D.H.CJ; B.E.CF".
