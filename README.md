# puzzles
Collecting my solutions here for some interesting math/programming puzzles.
Will keep transferring more here as time permits.
Hoping to eventually collect here my solutions for IBM Ponder This, Jane Street, Kominders Conundrums and 538 Riddler at least.
No stylistic coding, modularization; idea with these is to just get the job done with as little compute, memory and time spent as possible.
