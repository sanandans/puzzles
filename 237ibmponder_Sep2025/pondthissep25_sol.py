In this puzzle, successive wedges are being cut, flipped, and re-fused around the cake with no gap or
overlap between two successive cuts. A cut, flip, and re-fuse operation (all together) is a “step”
according to the puzzle. If the wedge angle theta (T) perfectly divides 2pi, as in the given example,
then we obviously need N = 2pi/T steps to make the whole cake non-iced on top for the first time, and
2N steps to make the whole cake iced on top again for the first time. Clearly, it’s not as
straightforward if T does not divide 2pi perfectly (as is the case with T = e^(-10) in the puzzle).
With such a T, the first time we go around the circle, there will be a leftover sector (central
angle < T) just before we cover the whole circle. When we do the next step, we would be including a
part of the old, first sector as well apart from the leftover piece. I first used a toy example to
discern a pattern. Suppose T covers 30% of the circle (T ‎ =  3pi/5 radians). Let the first three
wedges  processed be T1, T2, T3 which would all be non-iced on top after three steps. We would have
10% of the cake remaining with icing on top. Let us call this central angle P (pi/5 in this toy
example). When we do the 4th step, it would include this remaining piece as well as angle Q = T - P
from sector T1. The 4th step would not include T - (T - P) ‎ =  P central angle of T1. The 5th step
would include that angle P of T1 as well as angle Q from T2, and exclude angle P of T2. The 6th step
would include that angle P of T2 as well as angle Q of T3, and exclude angle P of T3. Then there’s the
angle P between sectors T3 and T1. We can visualize the whole circle as consisting of sectors Q1, P1,
Q2, P2, Q3, P3, P4, say in a clockwise direction. There are three Q sectors and four P sectors,
including two consecutive P sectors. For a step, we can treat the radial line between consecutive P’s
as one arm of the wedge angle, and the far radial line of the next Q in clockwise direction as the
other arm. The wedge angle will be P + Q = T, as desired. When we cut, flip, and re-fuse this wedge,
we will get consecutive P’s again. We can keep repeating this procedure using the radial line between
consecutive P’s as our guide. Let 1 denote iced on top for a sector, and 0 denote non-iced on top. The
first few steps would change states of the sectors as follows. In each state, the two consecutive P’s
are shown first. In the beginning, all the sectors are iced on top (state 1).

Step 1: P3 (1), P4 (1), Q1 (1), P1 (1), Q2 (1), P2 (1), Q3 (1) -> all sectors are iced; do the step on
the wedge containing P4 and Q1 -> P4 (0), P1 (1), Q2 (1), P2 (1), Q3 (1), P3 (1), Q1 (0).
Step 2: P4 (0), P1 (1), Q2 (1), P2 (1), Q3 (1), P3 (1), Q1 (0) -> do the step on the next wedge which
begins where the previous wedge ended and contains P1 and Q2 - > P1 (0), P2 (1), Q3 (1), P3 (1), Q1 (0),
P4 (0), Q2 (0).
Step 3: P1 (0), P2 (1), Q3 (1), P3 (1), Q1 (0), P4 (0), Q2 (0) -> do the step on the next wedge which
begins where the previous wedge ended and contains P2 and Q3 - > P2 (0), P3 (1), Q1 (0), P4 (0), Q2 (0),
P1 (0), Q3 (0).
Step 4: P2 (0), P3 (1), Q1 (0), P4 (0), Q2 (0), P1 (0), Q3 (0) -> do the step on the next wedge which
begins where the previous wedge ended and contains P3 and Q1 - > P3 (0), P4 (0), Q2 (0), P1 (0), Q3 (0),
P2 (0), Q1 (1).

And so on.

In the first three steps, we flipped three P sectors and three Q sectors. In the 4th step, we flipped the
remaining one P sector but also flipped a Q sector a second time (back to iced). This is the result of
having four P sectors and one less Q sector, and having the sectors in a pattern of Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, P
at each step. Clearly, all the Q sectors are non-iced on top after 3 steps, and hence all of them will be
iced again after 6 steps, and then all non-iced again after 9 steps, and then all iced again after 12
steps, and so on. Similarly, all the P sectors are non-iced on top after 4 steps, and hence all of them
will be iced again after 8 steps, and then all non-iced again after 12 steps, and then all iced again
after 16 steps, and so on. So, Q sectors become iced again after 6, 12, 18, 24, 30... steps, and P sectors
become iced again after 8, 16, 24, 32... steps. We can see that the whole cake (all Q and P sectors
together) becomes iced again for the first time after 24 steps, i.e. the least common multiple of 6 and 8,
and then again after 48, 72, 96... steps (at every common multiple of 6 and 8).

We can obviously extend the procedure of the toy example above to any wedge angle T. It clearly doesn’t
matter what the actual values of angles P and Q are as long as P is not zero (if P is 0, as in the
example given in the puzzle, we know that we can make the whole cake iced on top again trivially in
2N = 4pi/T steps). When P > 0, let N = floor(2pi/T). Then, all the Q sectors become iced again after 2N,
4N, 6N... steps. And all the P sectors become iced again after 2(N+1), 4(N+1), 6(N+1)... steps. So, the
first time the whole cake (all Q and P sectors together) becomes iced again is the LCM of 2N and 2(N+1),
which is 2N(N+1).

In the puzzle, 2pi / e^(-10) ‎ = 138396.366 approximately. So, N = 138396. The circle can be visualized as
having sectors Q1, P1, Q2, P2… Q138396, P138396, P138397 in clockwise order. Using the procedure described
for the toy example above, all the Q sectors will be non-iced after 138396 steps, then iced again after
138396 x 2 steps, then non-iced again after 138396 x 3 steps, and so on. All the P sectors will be
non-iced after 138397 steps, then iced again after 138397 x 2 steps, then non-iced again after 138397 x 3
steps, and so on. The whole cake will become iced again for the first time after 2 x 138396 x 138397 ‎
= 38,307,182,424 steps (the LCM of 138396 x 2 and 138397 x 2).

For the bonus puzzle, we can see that the whole cake can NEVER become fully non-iced (all icing on bottom).
The Q sectors all become non-iced after N, 3N, 5N... steps. And the P sectors all become non-iced after
N+1, 3(N+1), 5(N+1)... steps. Clearly, there is no number common between these two infinite sets of
numbers. If N is even, as in this puzzle, then all the numbers in the first set are even, and all the
numbers in the second set are odd. Similarly, if N was odd, then all the numbers in the first set would
be odd, and all the numbers in the second set would be even. The whole cake can reach “non-iced on top”
state (all icing on bottom) only if the wedge angle theta perfectly divides 2pi, as in the example given
in the puzzle.

This approach works for any wedge angle T, 0 < T < 2pi. If N = 2pi/T is an integer, then the whole cake
can become iced again on top for the first time after 2N steps (and fully non-iced on top for the first
time after N steps). If N is not an integer, then the whole cake can become iced again on top for the
first time after 2N(N+1) steps but can never become fully non-iced on top. In particular, if pi < T < 2pi,
the whole cake can become iced again on top for the first time after 2 x 1 * 2 ‎ = 4 steps (and can never
become fully non-iced on top).

Though no coding was needed for this puzzle, I wrote a short code snippet below to compute the number of
steps to make the whole cake iced again on top for the first time for any given wedge angle theta
(0 < theta < 2pi), and the number of steps to make the whole cake non-iced on top for the first time if
theta perfectly divides 2pi. To specify an angle that perfectly divides 2pi, express it in terms of pi
below rather than a number.

if num_q_sectors*THETA == 2*math.pi:
    print("Min num steps to flip whole cake to iced again:", 2*num_q_sectors)
    print("Min num steps to flip whole cake to non-iced:", num_q_sectors)
else:
    print("Min num steps to flip whole cake to iced again:", 2 * num_q_sectors * (num_q_sectors+1))
    print("Whole cake cannot be flipped to non-iced")
